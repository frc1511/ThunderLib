# ThunderLib

**ThunderLib is still being actively developed. Beta versions of ThunderLib+ThunderAuto are planned for November 2025.**

ThunderLib is a Java and C++ robot-side library for FRC robots that includes [ThunderAuto](https://github.com/frc1511/ThunderAuto) support and other useful utilities. 

ThunderLib provides the ability to read ThunderAuto files and execute ThunderAuto modes and trajectories in only a few lines of Java or C++ code.
